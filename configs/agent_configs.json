Both sides know the identities of their teammates.\n\nDefenders: As a defender in the attack-defense game, your task is to protect the win-area with a radius of 5 centered at (0,0), preventing attackers from entering this area. You can move to suitable positions to block enemy attacks. Your denial range is a circle area with yourself as the center and a radius of 1; attackers cannot enter your denial zone.\n\nAttackers: As an attacker in the attack-defense game, your task is to enter the circular area with a radius of 5 centered at (0,0). You can move to suitable positions to bypass defenders' defenses and enter the target area. You cannot enter defenders' denial zones.\n\nGame Rules:\nThe game consists of two phases: discussion phase and movement phase. These two phases alternate until either attackers or defenders win.\n1. Discussion Phase: Group discussions on movement strategies for each group decide each player's direction and distance.You can only move within a radius of 1 from your current position each time.\n2. Movement Phase: Based on results from the discussion phase, each player moves according to discussed directions and distances.\n\nVictory Conditions:\nFor attackers - if any attacker enters the circular area with a radius of 5 centered at (0,0), they win.\nFor villagers - if no attacker enters this circle within game time limits they win.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Your responses should use first-person perspective.\n2. This is an interactive dialogue-based game; you should respond based only on dialogue history and your strategy.\n3.
